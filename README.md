1. Project Title / Headline

💳 Bank Loan Performance Dashboard: Loan Applications, Funding, and Risk Insights

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze loan applications, funding distribution, and repayment performance across multiple borrower demographics, loan types, and states — empowering banks to monitor portfolio health, identify risks, and optimize lending strategies.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Bank Loan Performance Dashboard provides a consolidated view of borrower behavior, loan funding, and repayment outcomes. It enables analysts, managers, and executives to:

Track loan applications vs. funded amounts by grade, purpose, and term.

Assess good vs. bad loan performance across borrower attributes.

Identify risk factors tied to employment length, home ownership, and state.

Improve credit risk models by monitoring historical trends and repayment outcomes.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core visualization and reporting platform
• 🔄 Power Query (M) – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Loan risk metrics (good vs. bad %, charge-off ratio)
• 🗄 SQL Database – Source of borrower, loan, and repayment data
• 💻 SQL Queries (Aggregates, Joins) – Prepared datasets for Power BI ingestion
• 📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project)

4. Data Source

Source: Bank loan dataset (sample lending data across U.S. states).

Includes:

Loan details: amount applied, funded amount, grade, purpose, term, interest rate.

Borrower attributes: employment length, home ownership, state.

Performance metrics: loan status (current, fully paid, charged-off), good vs. bad loan split.

5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem

Financial institutions often struggle with:

Differentiating high- vs. low-risk borrowers.

Identifying loan purpose trends tied to defaults.

Monitoring repayment across demographics (state, grade, home ownership).

Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a clear, visual, data-driven solution to:

Track loan health and funding efficiency.

Support underwriting policies with evidence-based insights.

Improve profitability by reducing exposure to risky loan categories.

6. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

🔹 Top KPIs Panel

Total Applications (≈38K) – Loan applications received.

Total Funded Amount (≈$435M) – Actual loans disbursed.

Good Loans (≈33K) – Performing loans (fully paid/current).

Bad Loans (≈5K) – Charged-off or defaulted loans.

Good Loan % vs Bad Loan % – Portfolio risk benchmark.

🔹 Loan Purpose (Bar Chart)

Highest funding in Debt Consolidation, followed by Credit Card refinancing.

Small Business loans show a higher share of bad loans → risk hotspot.

🔹 Loan Grade (Donut Chart)

Loans distributed by grade (A–G).

Lower grades (E, F, G) carry higher default ratios.

Grade B loans dominate portfolio share.

🔹 State-wise Loan Applications (Map)

Concentrations in CA, TX, NY, FL (top lending states).

Regional loan demand patterns provide underwriting insights.

🔹 Home Ownership (Bar Chart)

Borrowers with Mortgage are the largest segment.

Renters show slightly higher bad loan ratios vs. homeowners.

🔹 Employment Length (Column Chart)

Borrowers with 10+ years of experience are the largest group.

<2 years employment → higher risk segment.

🔹 Loan Term (Pie Chart)

Majority of loans are 36 months, fewer at 60 months.

Longer terms trend with higher defaults.

🔹 Loan Status (Stacked Bar)

Fully Paid & Current dominate, but Charged-Off remains a notable risk category.

🔹 Detailed Loan Table (Matrix)

Columns include Borrower ID, Loan Amount, Funded Amount, Term, Grade, Purpose, Home Ownership, Employment Length, Loan Status, and Loan Performance classification (Good vs Bad).

7. Business Impact & Insights

📊 Portfolio Risk Monitoring: Lenders can identify high-default loan purposes (e.g., small business loans) and adjust policies.

💰 Funding vs Applications: The dashboard highlights efficiency gaps (loans applied vs actually funded).

⚠️ Borrower Risk Factors: Attributes like employment <2 years, renting, or lower loan grades correlate with bad loans.

🎯 Geographic Insights: Certain states show higher loan volumes, guiding regional underwriting strategies.

✅ Strategic Decision Support: By integrating performance (good vs bad loans), banks can refine lending criteria, improve ROI, and strengthen portfolio health.)
